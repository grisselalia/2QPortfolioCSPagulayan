        <p style ="color:#4375aa; font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px;">Armin Arlert, born on November 3rd in the Shiganshina District, is  considered as 1 of the 2 deuteragonists in Attack on Titan. He's the best friend of Eren Yeager (the protagonist) and Mikasa Ackerman. After the titans attacked and broke through Wall Maria, he [once he was of age] went on to take part in the 104th Training Corps to train for the Military. Although he did not make it to the top 10 of the class, he still graduated and joined the Survey Corps alongside his best friends.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p style ="color:#4375aa; font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px;">He is considered as one of the physically weakest soldiers of the 104th Training Corps, defeating a total of [at least] 2 titans on his own. His incredible intelligence and strategic thinking, however, makes him a very valuable asset to them. With his wits, he was appointed by Hange Zoe (the commander before him) as the 15th and current Commander of the Survey Corps. Not only is he the Commander, but he is also the bearer of the Colossal Titan.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p style ="color:#4375aa; font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px;">Armin has a kind heart and is a generally emotionally sensitive and empathetic person, however, he strongly believes that decisions should not be blinded by emotions. He views things in an analytical way and uses logic to make decisions. He is also loyal and selfless and is willing to sacrifice himself if it meant the betterment of humanity. He's overall a very complex character that is both sweet and smart.</p>
